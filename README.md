# Last-Stand-Horde-Siege
<p>Week 6: Mod 1: The Game</p>
<img src="images/lastStandHordeSeige.JPG"/>
<p>This game was created as a school project for the web development course at Per Scholas.</p>
<p>This is my current work in progress verison of the ever popular and newish reverse bullet hell genre of games/ tower defense</p>
<p>The main objective of the game is to survive as long as possible, while racking up a high score</p>
<p>More features to come....</p>

<h2>How to play:</h2>
<p>Once you click on "Click to Slay!" You will be brought to your base.</p>
<p>Project your base at all costs by clicking on the incoming monsters that will rapidly approach your base.</p>
<p>Clicking on them will shoot out a projectile.</p>
<p>Killing monsters give you points.</p>
<p>Keep doing this until you are defeated.</p>
<p>If you get defeated, click on the "Play again" button to start another round.</p>

<h2>How I built the game:</h2>
<p>This game was built with HTML,CSS, and JavaScript</p>
<p>Before I started working on the game, I used paint to sketch out what I wanted the game to look like:</p>

<p>As you can see, I am not the greatest artist, but hopefully this drawing gives you some of an idea of what I was going for.</p>
<p>Most of the code was done using HTML5 Canvas. Up until now, I never really used it before so this project was quite interesting, and I had a lot of fun putting things together.</p>

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
<p>I faced a lot of challenges trying to get this whole thing to work, especially since I've never done anything like this before.</p>
<p>Trying to get the projectiles to shoot where I wanted it aimed based off the mouse location...</p>
<p>Getting canvas and objects in the canvas to appear and change up based off of screen size...</p>
<p>Getting the enemies to function to know where the base is, and getting them to attack it properly...</p>
<p>Just to name a few of the problems no doubt...</p>
<p>But overall and good time putting it all together so far.</p>
<h>Features I would like to add:</h>
<p>A turret system that will auto shoot the monsters for you</p>
<p>Better scaling difficultly</p>
<p>Scores being saved</p>
<p>Using your points to create alt fire abilities</p>
<p>Powerups</p>
<p>Particle effects</p>
<p>Better mobile version</p>
<p>Voice over effects</p
